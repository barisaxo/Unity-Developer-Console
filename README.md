# Unity-Developer-Console
A generic and game-agnostic developer console in Unity. 

## Usage

1. Toggle the developer console open and close by pressing the \` (backtick) key.
2. Use the developer console command-line interface. Type and execute the `HELP` command for a list of all available commands.
3. For more information about a specific command, type and execute `HELP <COMMAND>`.

That's it!

I decided to go with a retro green and uppercase font because that's the only thing makes sense (those familiar with the Apple II series may appreciate it). Also, it's to provide an example for how to use a custom font. 

Lastly, this developer console prints logs, warnings, and exceptions from Unity's editor console. This is useful for visualizing logs in your build.

Enjoy!
